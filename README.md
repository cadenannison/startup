You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

- In app messaging?

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - There will be two HTML pages: one for user login and registration, and another for displaying sports events. The events page will list each event with its time, location, and the number of players committed. 
- **CSS** - Website will use responsive design so it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. It will include clean whitespace around event cards and player lists, and use a sports-themed color palette with strong contrast for easy readability.
- **React** - Will handle the core interactions of the site. Will provide login and logout functionality, display the list of events and their details, track player commitments by allowing users to join or leave events, update player counts dynamically, and make API calls to google maps.
- **Service** - Will provide endpoints to retrieve event data, submit player commitments, and fetch the current number of players for each event. It will also allow users to register, log in, and log out securely
- **DB/Login** - Will store user authentication details, all sports event information (including time, location, and description), and the commitments of players who have joined each event.
- **WebSocket** - When a user commits to or cancels their attendance for an event, WebSockets will broadcast the update so all other users see the new player count in real time.

- [X] **Proper HTML element usage** - I used different HTML elements to create my web application. I used within each of my html files the different html tags such as body, nav, main, header, footer, etc in order to organize and style my page. I also used "style".

- [X] **Text** - I included text within my webpage. The text can be seen by the title, within the different boxes, in the footer, and part of the body for my games and info pages. 
- [X] **3rd party API placeholder** - I created a box for the google maps api on the games page!
- [X] **Images** - I included a logo for my website on the info page and I plan to implement it in other parts of the website with CSS. 
- [X] **Login placeholder** - I included a login placeholder in the index page and I should be able to update automatically with java script in the top right corner the "logged in as". 
- [X] **DB data placeholder** - I have a placeholder for my data base where all the past activities will be stored and shown by the server on the games page. 
- [X] **WebSocket placeholder** - I also made the activities box the place where the websocket holder will be displayed as it will update as people create and upload new activities on the games page.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] **Header, footer, and main content body** - I made my header include a title, nav elements, and a sign in username placeholder. These are styled with color and spaced.

- [X] **Navigation elements** - I have a navigation bar with a hamburger button that uses bootstrap to make a responsive menu.
- [X] **Responsive to window resizing** - When I move my window around, the elements autonmatically expand or collapse so that the view is always visible on boht computer and mobile. 
- [x] **Application elements** - I created buttons on the sign in page. I also have a form creation area on my games.html page where people can create and post their activity. There is a small hover animation on the last content box in the info page. 
- [X] **Application text content** - There is text on every page including titles, paragraphs, and info boxes to guide users in using the application. 
- [X] **Application images** - I styled my website logo on the info page to be in a box and look cool. It can also expand to meet the window resize requirements. 

## ðŸš€ React part 1: Routing deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [X] **Bundled using Vite** - I downloaded and installed everything needed to bundle my application with Vite. 
- [X] **Components** - I was able to route my webapplication using the app.jsx file to build out my header and footer elements. then using BrowserRouter and the Route code pieces I was able to call the different parts of my website using react components and triggering the functions wihtin my jsx files for each page of my website. These I was able to isolate into a single file by moving my main HTML elements over and I was able to make everything fully functional. 
- [X] **Router** - I was able to build out the router within my app.css to route between the different react components instead of loading up new pages each time. This ended up being a bit difficult because a few small typos occured while I was importing the functions "jsx files", but I was able to debug everything so it went well.
