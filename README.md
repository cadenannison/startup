You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - There will be two HTML pages: one for user login and registration, and another for displaying sports events. The events page will list each event with its time, location, and the number of players committed. 
- **CSS** - Website will use responsive design so it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. It will include clean whitespace around event cards and player lists, and use a sports-themed color palette with strong contrast for easy readability.
- **React** - Will handle the core interactions of the site. Will provide login and logout functionality, display the list of events and their details, track player commitments by allowing users to join or leave events, update player counts dynamically, and make API calls to google maps.
- **Service** - Will provide endpoints to retrieve event data, submit player commitments, and fetch the current number of players for each event. It will also allow users to register, log in, and log out securely
- **DB/Login** - Will store user authentication details, all sports event information (including time, location, and description), and the commitments of players who have joined each event.
- **WebSocket** - When a user commits to or cancels their attendance for an event, WebSockets will broadcast the update so all other users see the new player count in real time.
