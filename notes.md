# CS 260 Notes

## Practice Using git and markdown

I just started learning how to use the commands for Git.

git clone
git pull
git commit -am "update notes"
git push
```
I also learned about using the "git status" and "git fetch" commands

Markdown: I learned a few syntax specifications for **using** _markdown_ more <ins>effectively</ins>
