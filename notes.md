# CS 260 Notes

## Practice Using git and markdown

I just started learning how to use the commands for Git. 
I learned how to use these:
```
git clone
git pull
git commit -am "update notes"
git push
git log
git checkout
```
git commit -am --> a is for add and m is a comment
git diff HEAD HEAD~1  -> difference between commits
I also learned about using the "git status" and "git fetch" commands


Markdown: I learned a few syntax specifications for **using** _markdown_ more <ins>effectively</ins>
